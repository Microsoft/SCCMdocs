# Plan for hybrid MDM with Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


> [!Important]  
> As of August 14, 2018, hybrid mobile device management is a [deprecated feature](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures). For more information, see [What is hybrid MDM](/sccm/mdm/understand/hybrid-mobile-device-management).<!--Intune feature 2683117-->  


You can only use one management solution, the mobile device management authority, to manage your mobile devices. Intune on Azure is Microsoft's recommended MDM solution. For more information, see the [Intune deployment planning, design and implementation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/plan-design/introduction). This guide provides information about the process of developing a deployment plan, creating a design, onboarding Intune, and conducting a production rollout.

For more information on hybrid MDM, see the following articles:
- [Supported device platforms](supported-device-platforms-for-hybrid.md) shows the mobile device platforms that are supported by Configuration Manager using Microsoft Intune.

- [Device enrollment methods](device-enrollment-methods.md) provides information about how to enroll corporate-owned and user-owned devices and their supported capabilities.
