# Manage applications for On-premises Mobile Device Management

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

When you manage devices through On-premises Mobile Device Management (MDM) in Configuration Manager, you can manage certain additional application types. Managing applications in on-premises MDM is the same as managing apps in a hybrid MDM environment.

[Manage mobile applications](management-tasks-applications.md) provides detailed information about creating and managing applications using hybrid MDM or on-premises MDM.
