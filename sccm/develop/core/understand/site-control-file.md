# Configuration Manager Site Control File
Site control in System Center Configuration Manager defines the settings for a specific site. The settings for each site are contained in the database and are accessed through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) when working with scripting languages, and through the managed SMS Provider library when working with a managed language.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Previous releases of Configuration Manager had a physical file that was processed for site settings referred to as the site control file. System Center Configuration Manager stores site settings directly in the site database; however, very little has changed when programmatically configuring a site.
