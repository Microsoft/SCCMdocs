# Configuration Manager NAP Server WMI Classes
Network Access Protection (NAP) server WMI classes in System Center Configuration Manager assist in assessment of NAP compliance.  

 The System Center Configuration Manager server class schema is a set of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes that represent the objects on a server that is running System Center Configuration Manager. Each System Center Configuration Manager class is a template for a managed object, and all instances of the object use the template. Classes can contain properties and methods. The properties describe the class data and the methods typically perform data management. For more information about developing applications using these classes, see [Configuration Manager Development Environment](../../../develop/core/reqs/about-configuration-manager-sdk-requirements.md).
