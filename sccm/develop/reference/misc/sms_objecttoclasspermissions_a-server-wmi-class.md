# SMS_ObjectToClassPermissions_a Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ObjectToClassPermissions_a` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that relates a secured object with various users that have class permissions on it.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ObjectToClassPermissions_a : SMS_BaseAssociation  
{  
      ref:SMS_UserClassPermissions classPermissions;  
      ref:SMS_SecuredObject object;  
};  
```  

## Properties  
 `classPermissions`  
 Data type: `ref:SMS_UserClassPermissions`  

 Access type: Read  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Reference to an [SMS_UserClassPermissions Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/misc/sms_userclasspermissions-server-wmi-class.md) object path uniquely identifying the location of the permissions object class instance.  

 `Object`  
 Data type: `ref:SMS_SecuredObject`  

 Access type: Read  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Reference to an [SMS_SecuredObject Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/misc/sms_securedobject-server-wmi-class.md) object path uniquely identifying the location of the secured object class instance.  

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Read (read-only)  

- Association: ToInstance  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  This class relates an instance of [SMS_SecuredObject Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/misc/sms_securedobject-server-wmi-class.md) with an instance of [SMS_UserClassPermissions Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/misc/sms_userclasspermissions-server-wmi-class.md).
