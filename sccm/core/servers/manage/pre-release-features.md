# Pre-release features in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Pre-release features are features that are in the current branch for early testing in a production environment. These features are fully supported, but still in active development. They might receive changes until they move out of the pre-release category.



## Give consent  

Before using pre-release features, give consent to use pre-release features. Giving consent is a one-time action per hierarchy that you can't undo. Until you give consent, you can't enable new pre-release features included with updates. After you turn on a pre-release feature, you can't turn it off.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Sites** node.  

2. Click **Hierarchy Settings** in the ribbon.  

3. On the **General** tab of Hierarchy Settings Properties, enable the option to **Consent to use pre-release features**. Click **OK**.  



## Enabling pre-release features

When you install an update that includes pre-release features, those features are visible in the Updates and Servicing Wizard with the regular features included in the update.

#### If you have given consent
In the Updates and Servicing Wizard, enable pre-release features. Select the pre-release features as you would any other feature.     

Optionally, wait to enable pre-release features later from the **Features** node under **Updates and Servicing** in the **Administration** workspace. Select a feature, and then click **Turn on** in the ribbon. Until you give consent, this option isn't available for use.

#### If you haven't given consent
In the Updates and Servicing Wizard, pre-release features are visible but you can't enable them. After the update is installed, these features are visible in the **Features** node. However, you can't enable them until you give consent.


> [!Important]  
> In a multi-site hierarchy, you can only enable optional or pre-release features from the central administration site. This behavior ensures there are no conflicts across the hierarchy. <!--507197-->  
> 
> If you gave consent at a stand-alone primary site, and then expand the hierarchy by installing a new central administration site, you must give consent again at the central administration site.  

When you enable a pre-release feature, the Configuration Manager hierarchy manager (HMAN) must process the change before that feature becomes available. Processing of the change is often immediate. Depending on the HMAN processing cycle, it can take up to 30 minutes to complete. After the change is processed, restart the console before using the feature.
