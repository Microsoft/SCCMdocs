# How to manage collections in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Use the overview information in this article to help you perform management tasks for collections in Configuration Manager.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about how to create Configuration Manager collections, see [How to create collections](/sccm/core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections).  



## <a name="bkmk_device"></a> How to manage device collections  

 In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Device Collections**, select the collection to manage, and then select a management task.  


#### Show Members
 Displays all of the resources that are members of the selected collection in a temporary node under the **Devices** node.


#### Add Selected Items
 Provides the following options: 

 - **Add Selected Items to Existing Device Collection**: Opens the **Select Collection** dialog box. Select the collection to which you want to add the members of the selected collection. The selected collection is included in this collection by using an **Include Collections** membership rule.  

 - **Add Selected Items to New Device Collection**: Opens the **Create Device Collection Wizard** where you can create a new collection. The selected collection is included in this collection by using an **Include Collections** membership rule.  


 For more information, see [How to create collections](/sccm/core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections).


#### Install Client
 Opens the **Install Client Wizard**. This wizard uses client push installation to install a Configuration Manager client on all computers in the selected collection. For more information, see [Client push installation](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers#BKMK_ClientPush).


#### Run Script
 Opens the **Run Script** wizard to run a PowerShell script on all of the clients in the collection. For more information, see [Create and run PowerShell scripts](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts).


#### Manage Affinity Requests
 Opens the **Manage User Device Affinity Requests** dialog box. Approve or reject pending requests to establish user device affinities for devices in the selected collection. For more information, see [Link users and devices with user device affinity](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/link-users-and-devices-with-user-device-affinity)


#### Clear Required PXE Deployments
 Clears any required PXE boot deployments from all members of the selected collection. For more information, see [Use PXE to deploy Windows over the network](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/use-pxe-to-deploy-windows-over-the-network).


#### Update Membership
 Evaluates the membership for the selected collection. For collections with many members, this update might take some time to finish. Use the **Refresh** action to update the display with the new collections members after the update is completed.


#### Add Resources
 Opens the **Add Resources to Collection** dialog box. Search for new resources to add to the selected collection. The icon for the selected collection displays an hourglass symbol while the update is in progress.


#### Client Notification
 Instructs all clients in the selected device collection to immediately do one of the following actions:

 - **Download Computer Policy**: Refresh the device policy. For more information, see [Initiate policy retrieval for a Configuration Manager client](/sccm/core/clients/manage/manage-clients#BKMK_PolicyRetrieval).  

 - **Download User Policy**: Refresh the user policy.  

 - **Collect Discovery Data**: Trigger clients to send a discovery data record (DDR). For more information, see [Heartbeat discovery](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods#bkmk_aboutHeartbeat).  

 - **Collect Software Inventory**: Trigger clients to run a software inventory cycle. For more information, see [Introduction to software inventory](/sccm/core/clients/manage/inventory/introduction-to-software-inventory).  

 - **Collect Hardware Inventory**: Trigger clients to run a hardware inventory cycle. For more information, see [Introduction to hardware inventory](/sccm/core/clients/manage/inventory/introduction-to-hardware-inventory).  

 - **Evaluate Application Deployments**: Trigger clients to run an application deployment evaluation cycle. For more information, see [Schedule re-evaluation for deployments](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings#schedule-re-evaluation-for-deployments).  

 - **Evaluate Software Update Deployments**: Trigger clients to run a software updates deployment evaluation cycle. For more information, see [Introduction to software updates](/sccm/sum/understand/software-updates-introduction).  

 - **Switch to the next Software Update Point**: Trigger clients to switch to the next available software update point. For more information, see [Software update point switching](/sccm/sum/plan-design/plan-for-software-updates#BKMK_SUPSwitching).  

 - **Evaluate Device Health Attestation**: Trigger Windows 10 clients to check and send their latest device health state. For more information, see [Health attestation](/sccm/core/servers/manage/health-attestation).  

 - **Check Conditional Access Compliance**: Trigger clients to check their compliance with conditional access. For more information, see [Manage access to O365 services for PCs](/sccm/mdm/deploy-use/manage-access-to-o365-services-for-pcs-managed-by-sccm).  


#### Endpoint Protection
 Instructs all clients in the selected device collection to immediately do one of the following actions:

 - **Full Scan**: Trigger Endpoint Protection or Windows Defender to run a *full* antimalware scan  

 - **Quick Scan**: Trigger Endpoint Protection or Windows Defender to run a *quick* antimalware scan  

 - **Download Definition**: Trigger Endpoint Protection or Windows Defender to download the latest antimalware definitions  


 For more information, see [Endpoint Protection in Configuration Manager](/sccm/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection).


#### Export
 Opens the **Export Collection Wizard** that helps you export this collection to a Managed Object Format (MOF) file. This file can then be archived or imported at another Configuration Manager site. When you export a collection, referenced collections aren't exported. A referenced collection is referenced by the selected collection through the use of an **Include** or **Exclude** rule.


#### Copy
 Creates a copy of the selected collection. The new collection uses the selected collection as a limiting collection.


#### Refresh
 Refresh the view.


#### Delete
 Deletes the selected collection. You can also delete all of the resources in the collection from the site database. 

 You can't delete the collections that are built into Configuration Manager. For a list of the built-in collections, see [Introduction to collections](/sccm/core/clients/manage/collections/introduction-to-collections#built-in-collections).


#### Simulate Deployment
 Opens the **Simulate Application Deployment Wizard**. This wizard lets you test the results of an application deployment without installing or uninstalling the application. For more information, see [How to simulate application deployments](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/simulate-application-deployments).


#### Deploy
 Displays the following options:  

 - **Application**: Opens the **Deploy Software Wizard**. Select and configure an application deployment to the selected collection. For more information, see [How to deploy applications](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications).
