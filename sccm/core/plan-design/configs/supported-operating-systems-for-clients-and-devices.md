# Supported OS versions for clients and devices for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

 Configuration Manager supports installing client software on Windows, Mac, Linux, and UNIX computers.  

#### Requirements and limitations for all clients  

-   Changing the startup type or **Log on as** settings for any Configuration Manager service isn't supported. This change can prevent key services from running correctly.    

-   Installing or running the Configuration Manager client for Linux or UNIX or the client for Mac on computers under an account other than root isn't supported. Doing so can prevent key services from running correctly.  



##  Windows computers  

 Use the client that's included with Configuration Manager to manage the following Windows OS versions. For more information, see [How to deploy clients to Windows computers](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers).

 Datacenter releases are supported but not certified for Configuration Manager. Hotfix support isn't offered for issues that are specific to Windows Server Datacenter Edition.  

#### <a name="bkmk_note2"></a> Note 2
 To support client push installation, the computer that runs this OS version must run the File Server role service for the File and Storage Services server role. For information about installing Windows features on a Server Core computer, see [Install roles, role services, and features by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/server-manager/install-or-uninstall-roles-role-services-or-features#BKMK_installwps).  

#### <a name="bkmk_note3"></a> Note 3
 The new Software Center app isn't supported on any version of Windows Server Core.<!--SCCMDocs issue 683-->



##  Windows Embedded computers  

 Manage Windows Embedded devices by installing the Configuration Manager client on the device. For more information, see [Planning for client deployment to Windows Embedded devices](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/plan/planning-for-client-deployment-to-windows-embedded-devices).  


### Requirements and limitations

    -   RAM File-Based Write Filters (FBWF)    

    -   Unified Write Filters (UWF)  

-   The Application Catalog isn't supported for any Windows Embedded device.  

-   Before you can monitor detected malware on Windows Embedded devices that are based on Windows XP, you must install the Microsoft Windows WMI scripting package on the device. Use Windows Embedded Target Designer to install this package. The files **WBEMDISP.DLL** and **WBEMDISP.TLB** must exist and be registered in the folder **%windir%\System32\WBEM** on the embedded device to ensure that detected malware is reported.

##  Linux and UNIX servers  

> [!Important]  
> As of March 22, 2018, the Linux and UNIX clients for Configuration Manager are deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecation announcement for Linux and Unix client support](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1802#deprecation-announcement-for-linux-and-unix-client-support).  

 Manage Linux and UNIX servers with the Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX.  

 The Linux and UNIX client installation packages aren't supplied with the Configuration Manager media. Download the **Clients for Additional Operating Systems** from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525184). In addition to client installation packages, the client download includes the script that manages the installation of the client on each computer.  


### Requirements and limitations

-   To review OS file dependencies for the client for Linux and UNIX, see [Prerequisites for client deployment to Linux and UNIX servers](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/plan/planning-for-client-deployment-to-linux-and-unix-computers#BKMK_ClientDeployPrereqforLnU).  

-   For an overview of supported management capabilities for Linux or UNIX, see [How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-unix-and-linux-servers).  

-   For supported versions of Linux and UNIX, the listed version includes all subsequent minor versions. For example, CentOS version 6 includes  CentOS 6.3. Similarly, support for an OS that uses service packs (such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1) includes subsequent service packs for that OS version.  

-   For information about client installation packages and the Universal Agent, see [How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-unix-and-linux-servers).
