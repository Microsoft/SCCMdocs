## General notes

#### <a name="bkmk_note1"></a> Note 1: Distribution points
Distribution points support several different configurations that each have different requirements. In some cases, these configurations support installation not only on servers, but on client operating systems. For more information, see [Manage content and content infrastructure](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/manage-content-and-content-infrastructure).  

#### <a name="bkmk_note2"></a> Note 2: Site database servers
Site database servers aren't supported on a read-only domain controller (RODC). For more information, see the Microsoft Support article: [You may encounter problems when installing SQL Server on a domain controller](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2032911). 

Additionally, secondary site servers aren't supported on any domain controller.
