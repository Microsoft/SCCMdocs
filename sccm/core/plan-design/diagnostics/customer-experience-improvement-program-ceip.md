# Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

> [!Note]  
> Starting in Configuration Manager version 1802 the CEIP feature is removed from the product.

During installation of the Configuration Manager console, you can choose to participate in the **Customer Experience Improvement Program** (CEIP). CEIP is turned off by default. If it was previously enabled, it remains enabled.  

-   CEIP is separate from [Diagnostics and usage data for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/plan-design/diagnostics/diagnostics-and-usage-data.md).  

-   CEIP is per console. It collects data such as the number of times that each element is selected in the user interface.  

-   Read the [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).  

Change the CEIP settings per console installation. To change the settings, go to the console's backstage tab (the upper left tab with the drop-down arrow), and select **Customer Experience Improvement Program**.
